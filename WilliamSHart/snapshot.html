			  <P align="left">William S. Hart created a film style that revealed an 
			  authentic vision of the Old West. He made a major contribution 
			  to film history by developing and embodying the prototype of
			  the frontier hero. Fame, artistic recognition, and wealth were Hart's 
      		  rewards.</P>
      		  <P align=left>True to the spirit of Western heroes he had portrayed on screen, 
      		  Hart was humbly grateful to the fans who had supported his film career. 
      		  When he died in 1946 he left the bulk of his estate to the County of Los Angeles, 
      		  stipulating that his house and the ranch property were to be used as a museum and public park.
      		  <P align=left>For many years, funds raised by the Friends have been used to help maintain the mansion, 
      		  help with the animals in the park and clean/restore numerous art treasures.
