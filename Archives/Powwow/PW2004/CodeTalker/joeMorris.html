						<P>Mr. Joe Morris, Sr. is a full-blooded Navajo who was one of the
			Navajo Code Talkers, a program established by the Marine Corps in
			September 1942 to prevent interception of messages among units in the
			Pacific Campaign. He was born on April 19, 1926. He was raised on a
			Navajo Reservation at Indian Wells, AZ. Lying about his age when he
			was 17, he obtained a draft registration card. On April 20, 1944 he
			joined the United States Marine Corps. After passing the physical and
			written tests in Phoenix, AZ, he was sent by troop train for training
			in San Diego, CA.</P>
			<P>Mr. Morris completed his eight week Basic Training at San Diego
			Marine Recruit Depot. After graduation, he was assigned to the Navajo
			Communications School at Camp Pendlenton, Ca. The school lasted for
			five months and covered intensive Navajo language code communication
			skills and terms for the various types of military hardware and key
			military officials. This was especially difficult since Navajo is a
			spoken language with no reference to any modern concepts or
			properties. After completion of communications school, he was sent to
			the Pacific on December 15, 1944 for assignment in the Marine Combat
			Division. He was assigned to the 22nd Marine Regiment, 6th Marine
			Division. He was on Guadalcanal, Guam, Saipan, Okinawa, and Tinstao
			China. His awards include combat ribbons, Asiatic Pacific Theatre,
			and China Occupation medals. He also held the Rifle Expert Medal. He
			obtained the rank of Corporal prior to his discharge on August 20,
			1946. He has received a Certificate of Appreciation from the
			President of the United States for his duties as a Navajo Code Talker
			as well as a Certificate of Recognition from the State of California
			Senate.</P>
			<P>He is married to his wife, Charloette, and has three children; Joe
			Jr., Colleen, and Elliott. He also has three grandchildren.</P>
