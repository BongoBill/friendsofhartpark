            he had found the most wonderful place to take me. Yep, you guessed 
            it, Bill’s mansion. We were met by none other than Carol Sandmeier, 
            who gave us the VIP tour. Not long after that, she rang us up and 
            suggested that we come to a class that they were conducting so that 
            we could volunteer at the park. We both dug right in and started 
            giving tours and recruiting other folk to come join us. &nbsp;<O:P>

            years, but we see good things happening for the museum and park. I 
            am quite excited about the things on the horizon for the museum and 
            park. It is such a wonderful place for families to come and enjoy 
            what Bill bequeathed to all of us. Have you been to&nbsp; the park

            lost his best friend when his beloved Pinto Pony Fritz died at age 
            37. Fritz was not only Bill’s best friend and co-star he was the 
            love of Bill’s life. Fritz was almost as famous as Bill and had his 
            own fan club. The “Fritz Club” boasting a membership of some 11,000 
            members in 1921 was a very exclusive club.You had to have a Pinto to 
            be a member and one member was a Moroccan Prince who imported Pintos 
            from North Dakota. Fritz was one of the most popular horses in the 
            world and Bill’s fans would send boxes of sugar and wrote letters to 
            Fritz in care of Bill.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

            Bill had Fritz buried at the bottom of the hill of his Horseshoe 
            Ranch and had a huge stone monument erected to mark the site.The 
            monument reads, “A Loyal Comrade.” A tribute made from a man who 
            loved his horse to a Pinto Pony who stole the show and on more than 
            one occasion proved he would lay down his life for his 
            owner.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

            is buried and the weathered fence around the site has been in need 
            of some attention for some time. The volunteers here at William S. 
            Hart Park have taken on the project of sprucing up Fritz’s 
            gravesite.The project was delayed for some time when it was 
            discovered that the waterline to the site had been cut when Hart 
            Hall was built. After several years of waiting for county officials 
            to find the money to restore the water line, help came from the 
            local Kiwanis Club who came to our rescue and took on the project to 
            run a water line back to the site. Last Saturday November 16th 
            the<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>volunteers were 
            finally able to paint the white picket fence surrounding Fritz’s 
            grave.We were able to complete the project with a little help from a 
            friend. Barry Parker from Dunn Edwards Corporation donated the paint 
            and helped with the materials needed for the project. Next spring 
            the volunteers will be planting flowers at Fritz’s gravesite to 
            finish the project.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

            moccasins in the bookcase nearest the telephone booth. We believe 
            Bill wore them. They are beaded all over with the “lazy” stitch. 
            Certainly a misnomer in the eyes of the artists who work the stitch. 
            Many beads - eight, ten, or fifteen -may be positioned with one 
            stitch. In Bill’s Native American beadwork collection there are 
            stunning pieces - vests, moccasins, a baby carrier, all completely 
            decorated in the lazy stitch. On the front of the moccasins are four 
            “tassels” formed from an acute triangle of tin. (Early Native 
            Americans found and recycled discarded flat tobacco and other tins 
            which they cut into many triangles, then curled them to use as 
            decoration on a variety of items: a woman’s dress, with many, many 
            of these clapless bells, as she walks there is a soft whispering 
            sound of movement; on moccasins (these have red-dyed horse hair from 
            mane or tail to enhance the tassel).While conducting tours during 
            the last pow wow I heard some real bells singing to everyone who 
            would listen. The sound traveled up the hill and soon filled Bill’s 
            home. We had a special visitor in handsome regalia with a profusion 
            of bells. He was one of the dancers from below who traditionally and 
            proudly had made their own regalia and so was knowledgeable about 
            the art forms. He said Bill’s moccasins were Cheyenne with trail 
            dusters. <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>

            sharing that story with some of my tours. Of course, the old oaken 
            ice box in the kitchen can be an introduction to the story. Ice was 
            delivered daily in most cities and towns, originally by horse drawn 
            wagon, later by Ford Model T trucks, complete with rear canvas flap 
            to retain the cold, and still later by newer trucks, into the 1930’s 
            The householder put a blue and white sign in a front window to tell 
            the iceman to stop. If twenty five or forty or fifty pounds were 
            needed, the sign would indicate the weight by its position: right 
            side up meant one amount, upside down another, and on either side, a 
            third and fourth amount. <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>

            business and still serving Santa Clarita and nearby areas. Owner 
            Kathy Pape (former Board Director and loyal FHOP supporter) and team 
            have added other forms of ice -including to order blankets of snow

            newsboys used to congregate to keep warm. It was a bakery, corner of 
            First and Colden Streets. We stood on the iron grating. I can 
            remember vividly the precise location of every stand of cakes and 
            cookies exactly. A clergyman stopped one day and wanted to give ma a 
            pair of shoes. I would not take them so he had me agree to keep the 
            snow shoveled off the sidewalk in front of his church and rectory 
            until Christmas-time. My<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
            </SPAN>mother asked me to go to the little brick church to Sunday 
            School. I went to please her, but<O:P> go into a peck of trouble – 
            they heard my voice. It ended in my having to go to the big church, 
            where I shoveled snow, and sing on Christmas day. I was the soloist, 
            and an adult, paid choir accompanied me. The minister gave my mother 
            five dollars for my services.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

            There was not concealing those hateful tones if I made even a 
            gurgle. Every head was at once turned trying locate that 
            soprano-alto, or “whatever the-hell-it was”<O:P> voice. And at
