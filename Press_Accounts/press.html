            <P align=left><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Buffalo Bill is dead.&nbsp; 
            But Bill Hart still remains.&nbsp; And not even in his palmiest days 
            -- the days of his plainsmanship or the days of his showmanship -- 
            did the famous former stage star have an audience so great or a 
            following so enthusiastic as the famous latter.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>If I expected to get a bullet through 
            both ears and be snaked off my feet by a well thrown lasso, I was 
            disappointed.&nbsp; For William S. Hart did none of these things 
            when he greeted me.&nbsp;&nbsp; He just looked kind of "sad but 
            determined," as though he were accused of being a stage-robber and 
            didn't dare to defend himself.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Bill Hart's expression in real life is 
            very much the same as it is when you see him on the screen. He is 
            just Bill Hart. What more is there to be said about it?</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Of course there is much more to be said 
            about Bill, but about his appearance and his expression--not another 
            word. And I'll say he's pleasant. Why, he didn't even knock me out 
            and put his foot on my chest before inquiring my 
business!</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>We have all seen in the films a rugged, 
            gaunt individual with a face like a mule's, so "hard-boiled" of men 
            as to be almost beautiful; and we have seen this knight of the 
            plains do goodly deeds until that face, reflecting his homely, 
            heroic virtues, has registered kindliness, even tenderness.&nbsp; He 
            isn't always a cowpuncher with a barking "gat" in each fist.&nbsp; 
            Sometimes he's a lumberjack, sometimes he's a convict, sometimes a 
            sea captain, or a frontier preacher; but usually he's an outdoor 
            man, and always he's a HE-man, just as Galahad was a HE-man, virile 
            and admirable.<BR><BR>I found out lately whey those homely, heroic 
            virtues o'erspread the face of the man who fittingly bears such 
            sobriquets as "Blue Blazes Rawden," "The Tiger Man," "Two-Gun Hicks" 
            and "Shark Monroe."&nbsp; It's because his intimate personal 
            history--and his biography are as full of humble incidents and 
            homely lessons as Benjamin Franklin's, and thrice as 
            thrilling--shows that he himself HAS those simple 
            virtues.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>When you hear "Bill" Hart relate 
            unassumingly his experiences and beliefs, it's easy to understand 
            how he "got started" and never stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
            rough-and-ready terror of "bad men" I discovered in a regular 
            civilized OFFICE at his studio in Hollywood, ready to pack up for 
            going out "on location" in the Mojave desert for 10 days.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>He was wearing "store clothes"--a clean 
            white shirt, neat gray pants, plain black shoes. The son of a gun, 
            to use the language, of Windy Gap and Los Hope, Ariz., was actually 
            riding a swivel chair!&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Unless you consider the lack of a coat 
            and collar the mark of a plainsman, there was nothing of the wild 
            and woolly about this quiet, polite gentleman with the light brown 
            hair, determined frown, light blue eyes, high cheek bones, firm lips 
            with thoughtful lines about them, and strong jaw.&nbsp; Except that 
            he averaged one "damn" and one "hell" to the minute, he might have 
            been his own gentle pinto pony with the feed bag 
            on.&nbsp;<BR><BR>You've got to go back into his history a bit to 
            understand "how Bill Hart did it"; how this raw youth of 18, who had 
            lived in Dakota territory until he was 15, playing, riding bareback 
            and shooting with Sioux Indian kids, got his first stage job as a 
            "super" at Drury Lane theater in London and a few weeks later lied 
            his way to New York into his first part in a road show; and how he 
            was first starred on the road in 1902 as John Storm in "The 
            Christian." And then you'll want to know how in 1913, with an 
            established reputation in Shakespearean and classic drama and later 
            in western roles, he refused an offer to be featured in a Broadway 
            production in 1914 to star, at less than one-fourth the salary, in 
            his first picture with Triangle.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Today, instead of being a star and 
            leading man at three or four hundred a week facing an average 
            audience of 800, he stars before from eight to ten million people a 
            day in about sixty pictures being shown all over the world, with--he 
            won't tell how much salary, "because I don't wish to bunk the 
            public, and what's the difference?&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>"I inherited what little stage ability I 
            have," said Mister Hart. And if you'd talked to him you'd call him 
            "Mister," too.&nbsp; "My grandfather on my father's side was one of 
            the greatest criminal lawyers in England, John Gleason Hart. My 
            father, Nicholas Hart, an Oxford<BR>man who came to Newburgh, N.Y., 
            where I was born, when he was a young man, after going around the 
            world before the mast, was a wonderful orator. "That's the best 
            talent in the world to inherit for the stage. A great orator is 
            necessarily a great actor.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>In his speech, his gesticulation, his 
            graceful postures in delivery, you have the elements of acting. 
            "From the time I was six months old till I was 15 we lived in Dakota 
            territory. I was playing with Sioux kids at their typical sports 
            while other boys of my age back in New York were playing baseball 
            and football.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>I knew and loved there, as a boy, the 
            western characters I played on the stage after playing Cash Hawkins 
            in 'The Squaw Man' with Faversham in New York in 1905.&nbsp; "I'd 
            ridden eight miles on a pony to a little Dakota school with five 
            pupils, but I'd had little formal education when my parents took me 
            to New York at 15.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>At public school they thought me 
            stubborn--and I can hardly blame 'em--and had my father before the 
            board of education to explain "I had Indian habits. I wouldn't say 
            'Good morning.' If they'd talk to me, I'd turn and walk away, as an 
            Indian does. An Indian doesn't say 'Goodby' or "Go to hell,' or 
            anything. I was stoical. "My father, who was a highly educated man, 
            decided I'd better be tutored at home. I was a big strapping kid, 
            anyhow, among a lot of children. For a year and a half he 'crammed' 
            me, and I passed the scholastic examination for West Point. You 
            needed 70 to pass, and I got 70.20.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>"He ground it in, but I was always great 
            on application--anything I went after I stayed with till I got "I 
            was crazy to go to West Point so I could get back West as an 
            officer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd always lived near forts, and was familiar 
            with soldier life. But my father couldn't get me an appointment, and 
            I was brokenhearted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>"I'll tell you a dramatic incident that 
            changed my whole life just then--I've never told this to anyone, I 
            think," continued Mr. Hart, his voice sinking to a whisper. "There 
            was a wonderful bond of affection between me and my father. I made 
            up my mind to run away from home. I went down to the East river 
            and<BR>made arrangements with a captain to let me work my way to 
            Australia. The boat was to sail at 5; I was to go on board at 4. I 
            made it, all right, crawling past my parents door with my belongings 
            in a bundle over my shoulder, but just as I closed the house door I 
            felt a hand on the other side of the knob.&nbsp; "It was my father, 
            in his nightgown. He questioned me, and I told him the boat would 
            reach Melbourne in six months. 'All right,&nbsp; laddie--I'll meet 
            you there,' he said--and he'd a been there, too. I went back to 
            bed!"&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Then young Hart, who had been spending 
            his spare quarters as<BR>a gallery god in New York, told his father 
            of his ambition to become an actor. His Dad explained that acting 
            was an art which called for culture and refinement and for which a 
            raw prairie boy wasn't fitted; but that if he was determined, he 
            should at least "break in" in Europe, seeing the best development of 
            centuries and getting the rough edges off him. He especially advised 
            him to learn fencing.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>But the elder Hart wasn't able to send 
            him abroad, being just about to take his family to plunge in a far 
            northwestern venture. So "Bill" worked his way on a cattle boat, 
            received $4.85 at the end of the trip, walked 208 miles from 
            Liverpool to London, and worked there till he saved up enough to 
            take him to Paris.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Noting the "Ici on parle Anglais" sign 
            in a store, Bill submitted a little idea of his own--delivering 
            parcels to people who spoke English--and delivered for four or five 
            firms. His room cost him five francs a week.&nbsp; Mornings he 
            washed windows and scrubbed floors at a fencing master's, to receive 
            "wonderful" lessons after hours from an assistant whom Bill, who was 
            always "handy with his hands," taught American boxing. Every night 
            he went to the theater.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>In 14 weeks Bill went back to London 
            and, being 18, tall and well made, without trouble got his job 
            carrying a spear. In four or five weeks he went back to 
            Liverpool--paying his fare this time--and was given free passage 
            home on a cattle boat. &nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>"I knew I had to lie and I did," Mr. 
            Hart explained regarding his landing his first part in New York. "It 
            was a white lie. I told 'em I'd played in London. I knew only how to 
            put paint on.&nbsp; "I got a job at $12 a week with Daniel E. 
            Bandmann, on the road in repertoire, including Shakespeare and such 
            plays as 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,' and in eight months I played 52 
            parts--juveniles, heavies,bits, old men, boys, 
            everything.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>"How did I work up from that to become a 
            star? The same way<BR>as others.&nbsp; It takes many years' service, 
            and I suppose there must have been some ability behind it. It's ten 
            thousand times harder to succeed on the stage, in my opinion. A 
            picture star can be made almost overnight."&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>After that first tour, Hart served his 
            apprenticeship with Madame Mojeska, Julia Arthur and Madame Rhea, 
            playing diversified roles, leads and heavies, in Shakespearean and 
            classic dramas. Following his being starred in "The Christian," Hart 
            was the original Messala in "Ben Hur."&nbsp;&nbsp; After his hit as 
            "The Virginian" in 1908-9 he played principally Western 
            roles.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>"You've got to keep attracting more 
            attention," Hart continued in explaining his rise to stardom, 
            "gradually getting better parts and better salary, always working 
            hard and making good.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Did I have to 'club' 'em into making me 
            a star? Managers are not to be clubbed. If they want you, they want 
            you, and you have mighty little to say about it; if they select you, 
            you can go down on your knees and thank God they found you--that's 
            been my experience."&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Walking down Euclid avenue in Cleveland, 
            where he was playing in "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine," one cold 
            winter night in 1913, Hart blew into a cinema house to keep warm. It 
            was the first picture he ever saw. He was thrilled, and obsessed 
            with the idea that his opportunity lay on the 
            screen.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>Rejecting the offer to be featured on 
            Broadway, he paid his own fare to California, and in 1914 began as 
            the "star"--at only $75 a week--in his first Triangle picture, "The 
            Bargain," with scenes in the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; He has been 
            starring in pictures ever since.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face=Tahoma size=2>In 1917 began the William S. Hart 
            Productions, Inc., for the Famous Players-Lasky corporation, 
            including "John Petticoats," in which, as a Washington lumberjack, 
            Hart inherits a modiste's shop in New Orleans, where scenes were 
            taken. He is now working on nine special productions he is to 
            produce himself, as his own boss and without limit on time or 
            footage.&nbsp; And that's "how" the pleasant gentleman in the swivel 
            chair--who could have shot the whiskers off my eyeball without 
            touching the lid--"did it."</FONT></P>

            PROPERTY</H4>
            <H5 align=center>&nbsp;</H5>William S. Hart has made some more 
            purchases of real estate around Newhall, he now having acquired a 
            225-foot frontage off the F.K. Naylor place. This piece includes the 
            site of 50x125 selected for the ranger station. Mr. Hart has 
            generously offered a 100-foot frontage besides, so that the station 
            grounds will have an area of 11,250 square feet. Mr. Hart has also 
            purchased the Cloe B. Anderson place of 5 acres which is within the 
            town limits. He will further improve his place purchased recently 
            from G.B. Smith, by the addition of a concrete wall of Spanish 
            architecture.

            <H5 align=center>&nbsp;</H5>Alterations on the new property recently 
            purchased by Will S. Hart, the eminent motion picture actor, from 
            Mrs. Anderson, which adjoins the property purchased by him from Geo. 
            B. Smith, were started this week. The (ranch) house will be 
            completely remodeled to meet the demands of the famous screen star, 
            who will make his residence here within the next few days. On the 
            premises are being planted about forty-five cedar trees which will 
            in all appearances make the home one of the best in this locality. 
            Mr. Hart will move to Newhall during the first part of December to 
            make his home temporarily. With him is coming his sister, Miss Mary 
            Hart, who has been in ill health for some time.

            <P>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer<BR><BR>It's the 
            plumbing that tends to stick in the minds of visitors to Santa 
            Clarita's William S. Hart Museum, not the fact that it was the home 
            of one of the most famous cowboys in silent films, said 
            administrator Janis Ashley.&nbsp;"They're very impressed that we 
            have seven bathrooms in the house," she said with a laugh. "Forget 
            that we have an outstanding art collection."&nbsp;Helping visitors 
            see the man behind the bathrooms is only one of the challenges faced 
            by Ashley and her sole staffer. The William S. Hart house is the 
            museum nobody seems to know, despite its administrative ties to the 
            Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in Exposition Park. The 
            larger problem might be Hart himself and how time can dim even the 
            brightest celebrity. One of the creators of the Western film and, in 
            his day, the most popular screen actor in America, Hart made more 
            than 60 movies, all of them silent. &nbsp;<BR><BR>Pushed off the 
            screen by Tom Mix and other more charismatic cowboys, the long-faced 
            actor saw his stardom crumble like old film stock. Today, only 
            historians and hard-core film and Western buffs have the vaguest 
            idea who the tall, laconic cowboy actor was, Ashley 
            said.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Hart's diminished profile is reflected in the 
            number of visitors to the hilltop Hart Museum. According to Ashley, 
            15,000 visit annually. In contrast, the Getty Center averages more 
            than 10,000 visitors a weekend.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Having shot movies in 
            the Santa Clarita Valley, Hart bought land there and built a 22-room 
            house crammed with art and artifacts, including a choice collection 
            of Navajo rugs. The house, which cost $100,000, had features only a 
            star could afford, including a spiral staircase, a built-in food 
            warmer in the dining room and a hallway telephone booth. Paintings 
            by pal Charlie Russell and others hung on the walls, alongside 
            Hart's saddles and a pair of samurai swords.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Located on 
            San Fernando Road, off the Antelope Valley and Golden State 
            freeways, the house went to the county on Hart's death in 1946. As 
            he explained in a speech: "While I was making pictures, the people 
            gave me their nickels, dimes and quarters. When I am gone, I want 
            them to have my home."&nbsp;<BR><BR>"Part of our problem is you 
            can't see it from the street," Ashley said. "You have to be sort of 
            ambitious to come to the William S. Hart Museum."&nbsp;What Ashley 
            means is that you have to be willing to trudge a third of a mile up 
            a winding road from the parking lot, often in punishing heat, past a 
            sign that warns of 
            rattlesnakes.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>On 
            a recent weekday afternoon, a half-dozen visitors made the trek. 
            Edna Arias of North Hollywood had brought her son, Helbert, 21, and 
            daughter, Natalie, 6. Helbert had been here as a child and 
            remembered Hart's collection of firearms.&nbsp;<BR><BR>As they 
            walked, the air was tangy with eucalyptus, small creatures rustled 
            in the brush and, at one point, a pastoral vista of the Santa 
            Clarita Valley appeared. They passed eight bison, descendants of 
            buffalo donated by Walt Disney in the 1960s. Arias said she likes to 
            bring the children here to savor nature. Michael Mahoney, 49, who 
            works at a dairy in Michigan, was visiting with James and Karen 
            Moran of Lancaster. Before the tour, James Moran stood outside the 
            house savoring its Spanish colonial style. "I'm drawn to this kind 
            of architecture," he said. "Aluminum siding, that's the big thing in 
            Michigan."&nbsp;<BR><BR><FONT color=#800000><B>From Classical Actor 
            to 'Two-Gun Bill'&nbsp;</B></FONT><BR><BR>Ashley, who was a 
            volunteer at the museum for 13 years, rattles off Hart facts and 
            anecdotes. Born in the 1860s in Newburgh, N.Y., Hart was a classical 
            actor before he came West. He made his first Western at 49 and soon 
            became known as "the good-bad man" and "two-gun Bill."&nbsp; Ashley 
            points to a picture of Hart, who was 6-foot-2, towering over tiny 
            Mary Pickford, and explains that he was once as celebrated as 
            Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and even Charlie Chaplin.&nbsp;"He was 
            ridiculously popular," Ashley said. "People loved him."&nbsp; Ashley 
            appreciates Hart's pivotal role in shaping the idea of the American 
            West.&nbsp; "William S. Hart was the first cowboy actor to bring 
            authenticity to the Western film," she said. Real cowboys didn't 
            wear braid and sequins like Tom Mix and other rhinestone cowboys, 
            and neither did Hart. "A lot of cowboys wore old Civil War 
            uniforms--leftovers."&nbsp;<BR><BR>Paula Marantz Cohen is an English 
            professor and film historian at Drexel University who wrote about 
            Hart in a new book, "Silent Film and the Triumph of the American 
            Myth." She also credits Hart with creating a more authentic Western. 
            Dust kicked up by galloping horses was one of those touches, Cohen 
            said. Hart was the first Western filmmaker to forgo wetting down the 
            location and shoot the scene dust and all.&nbsp;When Cohen teaches 
            courses in silent film, Hart is always a hard sell: "His screen 
            persona doesn't work as well as Douglas Fairbanks'; students can 
            still relate to Fairbanks." Today's students also tend to be gaga 
            for Buster Keaton, she said. Hart's dour, moralistic character lacks 
            widespread appeal, she said, and the movies themselves present a 
            problem. They seem much more dated than, say, those of 
            Chaplin.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Beth Werling is the collections manager at the 
            Natural History Museum, and she is quick to emphasize how important 
            Hart was.&nbsp;"He was not the first actor to make a Western, but he 
            brought the strongest vision of the West to viewers," she said. "He 
            was the foremost interpreter of the West as a place that needed to 
            be tamed or civilized by Anglo-Americans."&nbsp; Hart brought to the 
            screen the same view of America that Theodore Roosevelt brought to 
            his bully pulpit and that Frederic Remington gave American art 
            galleries, Werling said.&nbsp;That view repels many contemporary 
            Americans. "It's very difficult to appreciate a Hart film today," 
            she said, "because there's a lot of righteous violence, there's 
            sexism, there's racism." Nonetheless, the good-bad man that Hart 
            created persists in the Western protagonists of Clint Eastwood and 
            others, Werling said.&nbsp;<BR><BR><FONT color=#800000><B>No 
            Filmmakers Can Use the House</B>&nbsp;<BR></FONT><BR>The museum's 
            fund-raising options are limited by the terms of Hart's will, Ashley 
            notes. Admission to the museum is free, as is parking, and must 
            remain so. And no one can benefit commercially from the property. 
            That means the museum can't make extra money the way so many locals 
            do: by renting out the house to filmmakers.&nbsp;"I'm not sure I'd 
            want them filming in the house. I've heard horror stories, "said 
            Ashley. But she'd be happy to see some wealthy benefactor pour money 
            into the institution, as businessman George C. Page did for the 
            museum at the La Brea tar pits named his honor, which is also linked 
            to the Natural History Museum.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Natural History foots 
            the bill for such Hart Museum needs as killing whatever was living 
            in Hart's 13 buffalo coats. The garments were cleaned, frozen and 
            unfrozen and tucked away in acid-free boxes. <FONT 
            color=#800000><B>The Friends of the William S. Hart Park and Museum 
            spent almost $45,000 last year on projects such as creating a 
            library of Hart movies.&nbsp;</B></FONT><BR><BR>The Natural History 
            Museum also spends $100,000 a year for two full-time educators, 
            including Ashley, according to Ann Muscat, its executive vice 
            president. That money helps provide tours to about 6,000 school 
            children annually and underwrites a program that brought two Hart 
            Museum programs--one on the Chumash Indians, the other on 
            cowboys--into 55 classrooms last 
            year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR><FONT 
            color=#800000><B>Plans Underway to Boost 
            Image</B>&nbsp;</FONT><BR><BR>Unlike grander museums, the Hart 
            Museum has an informal air. "Our tours are not set in stone," said 
            Ashley. "It's not like Disney, where you get to the hippo and have 
            to [give a predetermined spiel]." Muscat said the Natural History 
            Museum is working on a master plan to raise the profile of all three 
            branches. One likely change will be the showcasing of its Hollywood 
            collection, which is now open only to scholars. The Hart collection, 
            which includes his business records, is an important part of the 
            Hollywood material, she said.&nbsp;But Muscat has no illusions that 
            visitors will flock to Santa Clarita, no matter how vividly Hart's 
            story is told. "Some people on the Westside," she said, "perceive 
            Exposition Park as too far to go."&nbsp;</P>

            Sunday night for a fund-raiser featuring ghost hunter Richard 
            Senate.<BR><BR>Senate was introduced by museum administrator Janis 
            Ashley, who noted that it<BR>was her duty to say the museum did not 
            believe it was ``officially haunted.''<BR><BR>However, Senate has 
            seen Hart's ghost. West Hills paranormal investigator Robert

            he's never going back.<BR><BR>The evening began with Senate taking

            after a search of the house, the most energy emanated from Hart's 
            chair in his upstairs bedroom.<BR><BR>No ghost, no rattling chains

            Ellen, whom numerous employees and security guards claim to have 
            seen.<BR><BR>However, downstairs in the dining room, at least three 
            guests had a chat with an<BR>uninvited guest, using a pair of 
            Senate's dousing rods.<BR><BR>Senate explained that you can 
            communicate with spirits by asking them ``yes'' or ``no'' questions, 
            and the rods (one held in each hand), will cross if the answer is 
            ``yes.''<BR><BR>``Are you Mary Ellen?'' asked Erica Perez of Canyon 
            Country.<BR><BR>No.<BR><BR>``Did you live here 
            before?''<BR><BR>Yes.<BR><BR>Then Katie Sanderson of Granada Hills

            you<BR>happy?''<BR><BR>Yes.<BR><BR>Danielle Serna of Glendale was 
            the third to try chatting with the dead. The<BR>16-year-old 
            Immaculate Heart High School student, who attended with her English 
            teacher Tony Durante and several other students, had the best luck. 
            She learned the spirit was possibly the young starlet Jane Novak, 
            who supposedly had an affair with the older actor.<BR><BR>``It was 
            really a strange experience. It felt dreamlike, like something else 
            took the rods from me and moved them,'' said Serna, ``but it was 
            very easy for me to focus on what I was doing and not be distracted. 
            And, no, I've never done anything like this before,'' she added.</P>

            - When William S. Hart died in 1946, he left his beloved Newhall 
            mansion filled with all of his earthly belongings to Los Angeles 
            County to be used as a museum.<BR><BR>The question is, did the 
            silent movie star stick around to oversee the care of his precious 
            collections of American-Indian artifacts, weapons of the Old West 
            and Western paintings and sculpture?&nbsp;<BR><BR>During the years 
            since his death, Hart has been spotted reading the newspaper in the 
            mansion living room, standing by his desk chair in his bedroom and 
            hanging out in the room occupied by his beloved harlequin Great 
            Danes, known as the ``dogs' room''.<BR><BR>``Hart spent a lot of 
            time in the dogs' room, and he did a lot of work at his desk in his 
            bedroom,'' said museum director Janis Ashley, but she debunks any 
            claim that the mansion is haunted. ``I'm the biggest skeptic in the 
            world. I've been here at night and I've been here alone, and I've 
            never seen anything.''<BR><BR>But other people think they have. The 
            museum keeps a file of unexplained sightings with reports, some 
            dated and some not, from museum administrators, volunteers and 
            visitors who have seen or felt, not just Hart, but his sister, Mary 
            Ellen, and the dogs.<BR><BR>A visitor to the museum in 1992 claimed 
            to have seen Hart standing by the brown chair in front of the French 
            doors in the dogs' room, and later on the tour spotted Mary Ellen 
            looking out the back window of her room toward the sun deck 
            area.<BR><BR>A volunteer felt something brush against her and 
            instinctively began making a petting motion toward it, only to 
            realize that nothing was there. She presumed that it had been one of 
            Hart's beloved dogs.<BR><BR>The most recent sighting occurred in 
            1998, when a security guard making his last patrol of the museum for 
            the night looked into the window of the dogs' room and saw a 
            white-colored dog moving through the room from left to 
            right.<BR><BR>Ashley calls the sightings a ``self-fulfilling 
            prophesy'' for people who come to the museum expecting to see 
            something.``If you want to see something, you'll see something. If 
            you think it's haunted, you're going to find ghosts,'' she said. 
            Admittedly, the mansion does have a rather spooky atmosphere at 
            times. The ultraviolet coating on the windows cuts out sunlight to 
            protect the valuable contents, making the rooms darker than they 
            were in Hart's day.<BR><BR>And with all of Hart's possessions still 
            lying around on tables and chairs as if the man were just in the 
            room, it's easy to see how visitors' imaginations could be 
            inspired.&nbsp;</P>
            <P><BR>``He left everything to the county to be preserved exactly as 
            it was,'' Ashley said. ``That's what he wanted.'' So if the Newhall 
            resident does decide to return to his old digs, his slippers are 
            still resting by his bed in the bedroom, a box of cough drops are on 
            the bedside table, and the desk is still stocked with paper, 
            envelopes, and a quill pen in case he might wish to ``contact'' 
            someone.<BR><BR>``I think that since all of his things are here, 
            some people think he might still be here, too,'' Ashley 
            said.<BR><BR>Richard Senate, historian for the city of Ventura by 
            day and psychic researcher on the side, has visited Hart Mansion 
            with his ``ghost hunting'' equipment and says he got several strange 
            readings indicating a supernatural presence in the 
            house.&nbsp;<BR><BR>``I would dare say that what they've got is just 
            the tip of the iceberg. Lot's of people who have toured that place 
            have probably had experiences and just never told anyone,'' Senate 
            said.<BR><BR>Senate says that longtime museum workers who have never 
            seen anything may not be receptive to psychic energies, or perhaps 
            were just not in the right place at the right time.<BR><BR>``Just 
            because you've never seen anything doesn't mean that nothing is 
            there,'' he said. ``We're left with a lot of enigmas, and that's 
            what ghost hunting is all about.''</P>
