<P>
The home of William S. Hart is an historic house museum which contains original furnishings, an outstanding Western art collection, Native American artifacts and Hart's personal memorabilia from his days as an early cowboy movie star of the silver screen. Volunteers will learn about this fascinating man and his life, both in Hollywood and in Newhall. In addition to leading tours of the home, Volunteers are needed to give Outreach programs to local schools, to work in the gift shop and to help with collections care projects. There are opportunities for Volunteers to work with experts and to develop a variety of new skills while performing an important service to the community.
<br><br>
The William S. Hart Museum is an affiliate of the Los Angeles Natural History Museum. All volunteers receive the benefits of both museum programs and discounts.
