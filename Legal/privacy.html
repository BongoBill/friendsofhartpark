						<P><B>How Do We Use &quot;Cookies&quot;?</B><BR>
						Visitors should be aware that non-personal information and data
						may be automatically collected by the Friends Of Hart Park and Museum Website
						through the use of &quot;cookies.&quot; &quot;Cookies&quot; are
						small text files a Website can use to recognize repeat visitors,
						facilitate the visitor's ongoing access to and use of the site,
						and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate
						data that will allow content improvements. Cookies are not
